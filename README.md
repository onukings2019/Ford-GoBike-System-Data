I Changed the data type for start and end time, start and end station id, member birth year and bike share for all trip features, fill missing member birth year with 0.
Replace NaN in member gender column with no gender

## Summary of Findings

> From the investigation, most trips took place in the morning and night and it happened on Thursday. I could not get the complete year dataset from the link provided because it's no longing opening. The one I worked with has just two months data and most trips took place in the month of february 2019
> The average trip to 600 seconds (10 Minutes)
